My name is Nicolas Guedes, i'm 18 years old and I'am from Blumenau,Brazil, now-a-days i study about programming, i study computer science in an university, during my free time i like to spent playing an electric guitar, i'm not a person that likes to go around so much because i prefer do stay at home doing things that I like to do such as watching movies or series in english, listening to music, playing instruments etc. I've completed high school now I'm focused to get into this area to work and invest in my own life.

because i Have interest in this company, i think that in this job opportunity i could enhance myself and get a lot of knowledge during this process

I am very good at adaptating myself to a new different challenge of situation i can handle challenging situations just by looking for the problem in a different perspective and make it much easier

I think i am not a person who likes to go off his limits or things that involves my ethic, I try to solve everything with the knowledge that I have and if i cant solve it I try to learn about it 

I think I will be really worth for this company, i could help a lot in all the process that I'am involved with.

better, in 5 years I want to finish my course in the university, i want to invest my money and help my parents with it at home 

I try to separate the things i like to do, first I prioritize my well-being and then I focus on my tasks and when I  finish them i usually spend my time studying or playing video games
